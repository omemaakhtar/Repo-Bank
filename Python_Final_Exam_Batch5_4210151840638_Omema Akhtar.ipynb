        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a \"class.\"\n",
        "It involves hiding the internal details of how a class works and exposing only the necessary methods and attributes to the outside world.\n",
        "Encapsulation helps in data protection and prevents unintended modification of data, promoting data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (a \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (a \"base class\" or \"parent class\").\n",
        "It promotes code reusability by enabling the creation of new classes that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes.\n",
        "Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship, where a subclass is a specialized version of the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.\n",
        "It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is appropriate for their individual types.\n",
        "Polymorphism simplifies code and makes it more flexible by enabling the use of generic interfaces that can work with various types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential attributes and behaviors while ignoring unneeded details.\n",
        "It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
